# Bracket Balancing Checker

## Introduction

This simple Python script determines whether a given set of strings containing brackets is balanced or not. A string of brackets is considered balanced if it meets the following conditions:
1. It contains no unmatched brackets.
2. For every opening bracket, there is a corresponding closing bracket of the same type, and the brackets are properly nested.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bracket-balancer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd bracket-balancer
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python bracket_balancer.py
```

4. Input a set of strings containing brackets when prompted.

## Examples

### Exercise-1

**Input:**
```
{[()]},{[(])},{{[[(())]]}}
```

**Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

### Exercise-2

**Input:**
```
[],{},(),[}
```

**Output:**
```
YES
YES
YES
NO
```

## Notes

- Make sure to provide well-formed strings containing only brackets.
- The script will output "YES" if the string is balanced and "NO" otherwise.
