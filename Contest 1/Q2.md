# Task Scheduling

## Problem Statement

You are given N tasks of varying durations, represented by an array A of size N. K workers are available, and each worker takes 1 unit of time to complete 1 unit of work. The goal is to find the minimum time required to complete all the tasks, with the constraint that each worker can only work on a continuous sequence of tasks.

To solve this problem, use the binary search algorithm to find the minimum time required.

## Input

The input consists of three lines:
1. The first line contains an integer N representing the number of tasks.
2. The second line contains N integers separated by space, representing the durations of the tasks.
3. The third line contains an integer K representing the number of workers.

## Output

Output a single integer representing the minimum time required to complete all tasks with the given number of workers.

## Examples

### Exercise-1

**Input:**
```
4
10 20 30 40
2
```

**Output:**
```
60
```

### Exercise-2

**Input:**
```
4
60 20 40 50
2
```

**Output:**
```
90
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the input values are valid and within reasonable constraints.
- The output should be the minimum time required for task completion.
